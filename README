Lab 8

Purpose: To practice creating and managing linked list structures.

Conclusions:

a) What I learned from this lab:
I learned how to properly allocate and manage memory for linked list structures 
and prevent memory leaks in a program. This is useful because linked lists are 
incredibly useful when an array just wont do.

b) How did the pair programming help/hinder the lab:
The pair programming helped me because I got to visuallize how to add/delete nodes 
in an existing linked list. This helped with the lab because I had to execute these
procedures correctly in the lab.

c) Issues and how I fixed them (bug report):
The only issue I had was in the collatz program where when I freed the list it didn't 
free all nodes. The issue was I had edited my head pointer to itterate earlier and I 
no longer had a reference to the beginning. I fixed this by creating an additional 
reference to my head.

d) Improvements that can be made:
In the future, I can improve my programs by using less unnecessary variables.
