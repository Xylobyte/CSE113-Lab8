Lab 7

Purpose: To practice creating and using a makefile. To practice using arrays and structures.

Conclusions:

a) What I learned from this lab:
I learned how to properly allocate and use strings as pointers in different functions.
This is useful because I now know a more efficient way of writing functions that 
have to do with arrays.

b) How did the pair programming help/hinder the lab:
The pair programming helped me because I got to practice writing functions that 
referred to arrays as pointers. However, the pair programming did not allow me to 
practice allocating memory for the arrays themselves.

c) Issues and how I fixed them (bug report):
I didn't have a lot of issues in this lab besides a couple of typos here and there.

d) Improvements that can be made:
In the future, I can improve my programs by breaking them down into more functions.
